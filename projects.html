        <h2>iOS Fitness Tracker</h2>
        <p>As an independent coding project, I created an <strong>iOS fitness tracker app</strong> using <em>Xcode</em> and <em>SwiftUI</em>. This application incorporates real-time health metrics, activity logging, and personalized workout plans. It integrates <em>HealthKit</em> for efficient data management, showcasing my proficiency in iOS development with a focus on enhancing user health. This project was developed in Hamden, CT and is ongoing.</p>

        <h2>RPG Game</h2>
        <p>This was a <strong>group coding project</strong> conducted in August 2022, where we used <em>Java</em> to develop an RPG game. The development process was managed through <em>GitHub</em>, allowing for collaborative coding, planning, and regular progress presentations. The project advanced weekly as we met deadlines and presented updates, creating an engaging and dynamic game that also served as an interactive learning experience.</p>
